# My learning
* created react project using npx command
* created a dummy component
* wrote some snapshot tests and provided component diff types of data from those tests
* executed command npm run test and snapshot folder got created
* Next time when i ran tests than every test run output is compared with already saved snapshots
* Made a change to dummy component(added class) and ran tests.Testcase started failing
* Updated snapshots and testcase started passing
* In this process how to test dom related changes using jest
